# Totoro's Natural Disaster Survival Guide

An interactive educational website designed to teach **children and teenagers** how to respond during natural disasters through storytelling, games, simulations, and real-world data visualisation. Guided by the friendly character Totoro, users can explore earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, floods, and more â€” in a way that is **engaging, inclusive, and trauma-aware**.

## Project Purpose

This project was created as part of my graduation thesis to:
- Raise awareness about natural disaster preparedness.
- Translate scientific and geographic data into **child-friendly visuals**.
- Use animation, games, and interactivity to **make safety memorable**.

## Totoro the Guide

Totoro is the friendly face across the site:
- He gives **tips and feedback** in games.
- He reacts to user answers.
- He offers **reassurance** and guidance throughout the experience.

Totoro was chosen to create a comforting and recognisable character for children that balances the seriousness of the topic.

## Educational Approach

This website integrates:
- **Scientific data** from real global events (e.g., Japan 2011, Chile 1960)
- **Design thinking** for accessibility and emotional safety
- **Visual and gamified learning** principles backed by child psychology

Ethical considerations were central, including the decision to **use fictionalised simulations** rather than real disaster footage.
